# MVP-Predictor


Hi guys this is my MVP predictor. The predictor works by taking all the NBA MVPS since 1987 as well as their top 3 candidates, and determining what years players were robbed of MVP. I do not fully agree with the list of robbed players, but it is interesting to look at when you realize from a statistical standpoint these players have a solid argument to be considered for MVP. The code works by taking the average of all the MVP's stat line, and from there, any player in the top 3 who met those conditions during a year the MVP did not meet those conditions was considered robbed of an MVP.
