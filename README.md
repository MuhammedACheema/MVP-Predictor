# MVP-Predictor


Hi guys this is my mvp predictor, it essentially works by taking all the nba MVPS since 1987 as well as their top 3 canditates, and determining what years players were robbed of MVP. I do not fully agree with the list of robbed players, but it is interesting to look at, when you realize from a statistical standpoint these players have a very solid argument to be considered for mvp.
